## Recommendation:

**£1/month for 3x/week automation is incredibly cheap!**

Even daily automation at £2.31/month is negligible compared to:
- Your Claude Pro subscription (£18/month)
- Your time (30 seconds/week = 2 hours/year)
- Perplexity alternative (£50+/month)

## Setup for Minimum Cost:

1. **Start with 1x/week** (£0.31/month) - Mondays at 3am
2. **Monitor results** for 1 month
3. **Increase to 3x/week** (£1/month) if you want more ideas
4. **Daily only if** you're publishing ideas rapidly

## How to Get Claude API Key:

2. Sign up (separate from Claude Pro - it's pay-as-you-go)
3. Add payment method
4. Create API key
5. You only pay for what you use!

## Free Credits:

New Anthropic accounts often get **$5 free credit** = ~650 runs = **2+ years of weekly automation**!

---

**Bottom Line**: For £1/month (price of a coffee), you get fully automated automation idea discovery 3x/week. That's 150+ ideas/year for the price of one Starbucks.
