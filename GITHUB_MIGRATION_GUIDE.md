# ðŸ”„ GitHub Migration Guide: MissCeptstudios â†’ Lumigentic

Guide to move repository from personal account to company organization.

---

## Option 1: Transfer Existing Repo (Recommended)

**If you own both accounts**, transfer the repo:

### Step 1: Go to GitHub
1. Open https://github.com/MissCeptstudios/LumiGentic
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Danger Zone**
4. Click **Transfer ownership**

### Step 2: Transfer to Lumigentic
1. New owner: `Lumigentic` (organization name)
2. Confirm transfer
3. Done! Repo is now at: `https://github.com/Lumigentic/LumiGentic`

### Step 3: Update Local Remote (I'll do this)
```bash
cd /Users/joannacholas/CursorProjects/LumiGentic/LumiGenticSite
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Lumigentic/LumiGentic.git
git remote -v  # Verify
```

## Option 2: Create New Repo on Lumigentic

**If you need to create fresh repo:**

### Step 1: Create Repo on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/orgs/Lumigentic/repositories (or your org)
2. Click **New repository**
3. Name: `LumiGentic` (or `lumigentic-website`)
4. Description: "AI Automation Platform - Smart Logistics Solutions"
5. **Private** or **Public** (your choice)
6. **DON'T** initialize with README (we already have code)
7. Click **Create repository**

### Step 2: You'll see this screen:
```
Quick setup â€” if you've done this kind of thing before

https://github.com/Lumigentic/LumiGentic.git

â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/Lumigentic/LumiGentic.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Copy the repo URL:** `https://github.com/Lumigentic/LumiGentic.git`

### Step 3: Tell me the URL
Once you have the new repo URL, I'll run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/joannacholas/CursorProjects/LumiGentic/LumiGenticSite

# Remove old remote
git remote remove origin

# Add new Lumigentic remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Lumigentic/LumiGentic.git

# Push all branches
git push -u origin deploy-production
git push -u origin main  # if you have main branch

# Verify
git remote -v
```

## Option 3: Fork to Lumigentic Org

1. Go to https://github.com/MissCeptstudios/LumiGentic
2. Click **Fork**
3. Select **Lumigentic** organization
4. Then follow Step 3 from Option 2

## What Happens After Migration?

### Vercel Auto-Updates
If Vercel is connected to the old repo:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Project â†’ **Settings** â†’ **Git**
3. Click **Disconnect**
4. Click **Connect Git Repository**
5. Select new `Lumigentic/LumiGentic` repo
6. Deploy!

### GitHub Actions (if any)
Will automatically work with new repo location.

### Collaborators
- You'll need to re-add collaborators to the new repo
- Go to **Settings** â†’ **Collaborators and teams**

---

## Checklist Before Migration

- [ ] Backup: Repo is already on your local machine âœ…
- [ ] Check: No open Pull Requests you need
- [ ] Check: No important Issues to transfer
- [ ] Decide: Keep old repo or delete after transfer?

## After Migration Verification

```bash
# Check remote is correct
git remote -v

# Should show:
# origin  https://github.com/Lumigentic/LumiGentic.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/Lumigentic/LumiGentic.git (push)

# Test push
git push origin deploy-production
```

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "Repository not found"
